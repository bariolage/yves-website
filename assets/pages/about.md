After studies in philosophy and science, the artist, who has been doing photography for pleasure for a long time, presents his work to his family, who encourage him in this way.

Stimulated, he takes evening classes at the Beaux-Arts of Brest to develop his artistic sensibility.

His work, between poetry and imagination, magnifies everyday objects such as glass bottle, drainer or fabric, once past behind his camera lens.

Reveal the extraordinary: in front of his photographs, the artist wishes that the public gives place to his imagination ...

"For now, I take art for a practice, a reflection on aesthetics." Yves le Bras.
